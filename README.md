Landing Page
This is a basic landing page I built using HTML and CSS for The Odin Project.

What it includes:
Header with navigation links
Main section with text and an image
Info section with boxes and text
A quote/testimonial section
Call to action section with a button
Footer

What I practiced:
Writing clean HTML
Using Flexbox for layout
Styling with CSS
Matching a reference design
